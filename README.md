# MarvelCollaborationNetwork

Data scraped from the Marvel API yielded an overall network of 1,400 nodes (individual characters) and 47,000 unique edges (represented by character collaborations within 14,500 comics published between 1939 and 2020)

This interactive interface lets you set the time period and explore the entire collaboration network (Global Mode) or search and select specific characters to see their local network (Local Mode). Use the Closeness Slider to specify the minimum number of collaborations needed to create an edge between two characters.

In Global Mode, explore the entirety of the network topology and see how characters naturally collaborate with their neighbors. Click on any hero you find to open Local Mode starting with them!

In Local Mode, click on neighbors to expand your network graph, and click on edges to open up a view of all interactions between characters (within the time period as well)
